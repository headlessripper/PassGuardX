A password manager is a tool that helps users store and manage their passwords securely. It typically provides a range of features to ensure that users can create, store, and retrieve complex passwords while maintaining privacy and security. Below are the most common features that password managers typically offer:

1. Password Storage
Secure Password Vault: A centralized encrypted location where all passwords, usernames, and other sensitive information are stored.
Encryption: Strong encryption algorithms (such as AES-256) ensure that stored data is protected from unauthorized access.
Automatic Password Storage: Automatically stores passwords and credentials as they are entered on websites or apps.
2. Password Generation
Password Generator: Generates strong, random passwords that are difficult to guess or brute-force. Users can specify parameters like password length and the inclusion of numbers, symbols, uppercase, and lowercase letters.
Customizable Passwords: Option to set specific criteria for password strength (e.g., length, complexity, character types).
3. Autofill & Autofill for Forms
Autofill: Automatically fills in login credentials on websites and apps (username, password, and sometimes two-factor authentication codes).
Autofill for Forms: Stores and autofills other forms, such as shipping addresses, credit card details, and more.
4. Cross-Platform Sync
Multi-Device Sync: Syncs passwords and data across all devices (e.g., desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets), allowing users to access their passwords from anywhere.
Cloud Backup: Many password managers use cloud storage to back up passwords and sync data across devices.
5. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
2FA Support: Integrates with two-factor authentication (2FA) methods (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy) to generate time-sensitive codes for extra security.
One-Time Password (OTP) Generation: Generates time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) for supported sites and services directly within the app.
6. Password Sharing
Secure Password Sharing: Allows users to securely share passwords or credentials with trusted people, with options to set permissions (e.g., view-only, edit).
Team/Family Accounts: Many password managers offer shared vaults for families or teams where passwords can be shared securely.
7. Password Health and Strength Checker
Password Strength Meter: Evaluates password strength and suggests improvements (e.g., mix of uppercase letters, numbers, symbols).
Weak Password Alerts: Notifies users if they have weak or reused passwords.
Breach Detection: Alerts users if any of their stored passwords have been exposed in a data breach (usually by cross-referencing with known breach databases like Have I Been Pwned).
8. Secure Notes and File Storage
Secure Notes: Allows users to store sensitive information (e.g., security questions, software licenses, bank account info) in an encrypted format.
File Storage: Provides encrypted storage for files, documents, or sensitive data alongside passwords.
9. Backup and Recovery
Emergency Access: Allows users to designate a trusted contact who can access their vault in case of emergency.
Password Recovery Options: Provides options to recover access if the user forgets their master password (e.g., recovery codes, security questions, email recovery).
10. Browser Extensions and Apps
Browser Extensions: Provides browser plugins for automatic password filling, form autofill, and saving passwords directly from the browser.
Mobile Apps: Apps for iOS and Android devices that allow users to access their passwords on the go.
11. Audit Logs and Usage History
Audit Logs: Tracks activities like password changes, login attempts, and vault access. Useful for security and accountability, especially in team settings.
History of Generated Passwords: Allows users to review and re-use previously generated passwords.
12. Password Expiry and Rotation
Password Expiry: Allows users to set passwords to expire after a certain period, prompting them to update them regularly.
Password Rotation: Some password managers automatically rotate passwords for services that support it.
13. Master Password & Biometric Authentication
Master Password: Users create a master password that unlocks the password manager. It should be long, complex, and unique.
Biometric Authentication: Allows users to log in with biometrics (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition) for added convenience on supported devices.
PIN Codes: Some managers offer PIN codes as a secondary authentication method for mobile devices.
14. Password Import/Export
Importing Passwords: Allows users to import passwords from browsers or other password managers.
Exporting Passwords: Some managers allow users to export their passwords as a backup (though this is typically done in encrypted formats to maintain security).
15. Dark Web Monitoring
Dark Web Scanning: Scans dark web sources to identify if any of the userâ€™s credentials have been exposed in a data breach.
16. Business/Enterprise Features
Enterprise Admin Features: For business users, many password managers offer tools for managing user permissions, policy enforcement, and centralized billing.
Role-based Access Control: Allows admins to control who has access to what information within an organization.
Integration with SSO: Many enterprise-level password managers support single sign-on (SSO) integration with other business tools and services.
17. Security Features
Zero-Knowledge Architecture: The password manager provider does not have access to your vault or your master password, ensuring privacy.
End-to-End Encryption: Ensures that only the user can decrypt their data, not even the service provider.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Allows the use of multiple factors (e.g., password + code sent to phone) for accessing the vault.
Self-Destruct/Lock After Idle: Automatically locks the vault after a period of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access.
18. Compatibility with Other Services
Support for Multiple Browsers: Ensures the password manager works across popular web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.
Integration with Other Apps: Some password managers integrate with other tools like password-protected websites, identity management software, etc.
